# PORTAL viewer project overview:

This project will serve as a code repository for a locally hosted virtual window to the world.

The goal is to have a minimal hardware requirement platform connected to a micro display (or macro) to display video feeds from around the world (streamed or locally hosted)
Observing the world as if through a window. 

This project is built initially for rasbperry pi 4B (4GB) with a microdisplay 5" circular screen to be encased in a decorative frame resembling a portcullis on a ship for wall-mounting,
But objectively there's no reason this couldn't be run on any hardware so I'll be trying to ensure the code is as generalized as possible to support multiple different platforms and equipment.
